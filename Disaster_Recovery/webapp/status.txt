1. Set up a new branch and put code into github
2. Do input form
3. Do Preferred Options output
4. Put dummy links into Preferred options
5. Look at code to see how to refactor
   a. Options class: bus/taxi, busid (if bus), cost
      - has public attributes for busid, taxi, cost
   b. PreferredOPtions class: 
      -has a dict of options; returns list with different sorts
   c. AlternativeOptions class:  
      - has a dict of options; returns different sorts
