Notes:

in 04_radius_Elimination
	shouldn't it always be a pickup that we're eliminating radiuses for
	also the lat lon should both be for dropoff on line 27
	we also hardcoded the radius to 5
	
	
Dimensions are attributes describing the measures, Measures are numbers 
First, clean up data: hide data columns you don't need, change types, check dim vs measures
Save as workbook for starting point 
You can use extracts, especially if you're not  going to be connected to wifi
twbx for those who don't have desktop tableau, just need the reader (free online)
